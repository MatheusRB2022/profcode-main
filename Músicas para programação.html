<br>
<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    I know you'll get stronge<br>
    When you get older<br>
    Just don't shrug your sho<br>
    When you get older<br>
    Things aren't easy<br>
    So just you believe me no<br>
    If you don't keep it cool<br>
    You'll never make a sound<br>
    All the lights will guide<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    All the fears will fade a<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    Leave excuses aside<br>
    Speak out your mind<br>
    Don't let in slide<br>
    You're not always <br>
    Things aren't easy<br>
    So just you believe me no<br>
    Don't learn the hard way<br>
    Just let me show you how<br>
    All the lights will guide<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    All the fears will fade a<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>
    If you get to hear me now<br>

<br>
Through the Milky Way<br>
In my spaceship<br>
At the speed of light<br>
I'm gonna make it<br>
I know you've been expecting me<br>
Turn on the cameras, take another scene<br>
We go like hands up, people, get with the show<br>
We're taking over, people, lose control<br>
Spin the decks, my DJ, reaching my soul<br>
Aim for the stars, my people, we never fall<br>
Yes, I'm an alien<br>
Alien<br>
Alien<br>
Alien<br>
Alien<br>
Alien<br>
Ali-ali-ali-ali<br>
This is the future<br>
Through the Milky Way<br>
In my spaceship<br>
At the speed of light<br>
I'm gonna make it<br>
I know you've been expecting me<br>
Turn on the cameras, take another scene<br>
We go like hands up, people, get with the show<br>
We're taking over, people, lose control<br>
Spin the decks, my DJ, reaching my soul<br>
Aim for the stars, my people, we never fall<br>
Yes, I'm an alien<br>
When I'm touching the earth<br> 
Call me a spaceman<br>
When I travel universe<br>
Yes, I'm an alien<br>
When I'm touching the earth<br>
Call me a spaceman<br>
When I travel univers<br>
Call me a spaceman<br>
Call me a spaceman<br>
Call me a spaceman<br>
Call me a spaceman<br>
Call me a spaceman<br>
Spaceman<br>
Spaceman<br>
Spaceman<br>
This is the future<br>

<br>
Pour another drink, I don't w<br>
Oh, it's been a long day<br>
Get out of your head, smoking<br>
Put that song on replay<br>

Don't worry now, look what we<br>
We don't have to go all-in<br>
Head in the clouds, both look<br>
Doesn't mean that we're falli<br>

We can keep it simple, baby<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Labels are so overrated<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Rules are meant for breaking,<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Why don't we just go get nake<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>

Let's not make it complicated<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>

Skinny dip at night, I can se<br>
Searchin' through the shadows<br>
You don't have to fight, I'll cide<br>
I can help you let go<br>

Don't worry now, look what we<br>
We don't have to go all-in<br>
Head in the clouds, both look<br>
Doesn't mean that we're falli<br>

We can keep it simple, baby<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Labels are so overrated<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Rules are meant for breaking,<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Why don't we just go get nake<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>

Let's not make it complicated<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>

Let's not make it complicated<br>
We can keep it simple, baby<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Labels are so overrated<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Rules are meant for breaking,<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>
Why don't we just go get nake<br>
Let's not make it complicated<br>

Let's not make it complicated<br>
